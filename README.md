# SurfaceDeploymentAccelerator
Surface Deployment Accelerator (SDA) is a script-driven tool to create Windows images (WIM) for test or deployment that closely match the configuration of Bare Metal Recovery (BMR) images, minus certain preinstalled applications like Microsoft Office and the Surface UWP application.

This tool is run via executiong "CreateSurfaceWindowsImage.ps1" as an administrator, and requires access to a Windows ISO file to provide the image to manipulate.  If driver or Windows updates are desired, internet access is required to download.  The script uses the Windows deployment tools from the ADK, so if the latest ADK is not already installed, it will be downloaded and installed during script execution.

The parameters that are available to the script are as follows:

-ISO                  Path to a Windows ISO file to use as the imaging source. (required)
-DestinationFolder    The folder used to place the resulting image files once complete. (required)
-Architecture         The architecture of the image in -ISO, valid values are x64 or ARM64, x64 is the default.  Note that ARM64 support is not complete in this build, please do not file bugs against this as of yet.
-DotNet35             Install .NET 3.5 in the image, True or False.  True is the default.
-ServicingStack       Download/inject latest servicing stack update, True or False.  True is the default.
-CumulativeUpdate     Download/inject latest cumulative update, True or False.  True is the default.
-AdobeFlashUpdate     Include latest Adobe Flash Player Security update, True or False.  True is the default.
-Device               Enter Surface device type to download and inject latest drivers for.  Possible values: SurfacePro4, SurfacePro5, SurfacePro6, SurfacePro7, SurfaceLaptop, SurfaceLaptop2, SurfaceLaptop3, SurfaceBook, SurfaceBook2, SurfaceStudio, SurfaceStudio2, SurfaceGo, SurfaceGoLTE.  If this parameter is not specified, no drivers will be injected.
-CreateUSB            Create bootable USB installation when finished, True or False.  False is the default.
-WindowsKitInstall    Enter target location of Windows ADK installation.  If not specified, the path "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit" will be used.
-InstallWIM           Edit Install.wim file, True or False.  True is default.
-BootWIM              Edit boot.wim, True or False.  True is default.  This can stop a boot.wim from being updated. If you're forcing it to use another boot.wim separate from one installed by ADK, you may want to set this to $false so the boot.wim isn't touched. If you choose $false, itâ€™s expected you're going to use your own boot.wim.  This will also cause -CreateUSBKey to be forced to False, regardless of value passed in.
-KeepOriginalWIM      Keep customized unsplit WIM even if resulting image size is greater than 4GB (images over 4GB are split into SWM by default), True or False.  True is default.
